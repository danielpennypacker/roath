,"I tried to go to the Convoy Council to try and get them to intervene, so send the navy, help evacuate, anything. But it all fell on deaf ears. I've heard those selfish bastards talk endlessly about the vacations they've had here, but once there's a real threat, they're nowhere to be seen."
,"Maybe this war has been brewing for too long, I know of colleagues sailing to other nations right now, just waiting to hear about the sack of Roath. Once everyone sees how the Osterogi treat an undefended city, they'll probably come begging to the Convoy for help."
,"My favorite thing has always been the morning after a big festival. The way the whole city gets up late, and there's always an extra hour of peace in the morning. You can just stroll through all the leftover mess and know what a great time everyone had."
