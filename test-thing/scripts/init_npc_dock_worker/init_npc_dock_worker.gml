You just arrived? This is a hell of a time to get here. The Osterog Navy will be landing tomorrow."

I've had plenty of work, that's for sure. At first no on believed they'd really be setting sail,

I'll be leaving soon too. I’ve been in Roath for a couple years, can't say I won’t miss it. 
I can't imagine it will stay the same once the Ostergy move in, and I'm not 
staying around to see what they wanna do with the place.

Everyone's been in a crazy mood, sharing their life stories scrambling to take what they can. 
AT least this is a good time to talk to people!
